# NOT a `moved` block, deliberately — do not "fix" this back into one, it
# will not work. `moved` requires the from/to resource TYPE to match exactly;
# it compares type names, not provider schemas. aws_alb_target_group and
# aws_lb_target_group are the same underlying AWS resource as far as the
# provider is concerned, but they are two distinct registered type names, so
# Terraform Core treats this as a cross-type move. Confirmed by reproducing
# it on Terraform v1.7.5:
#
#   Error: Resource type mismatch
#   This statement declares a move from aws_alb_target_group.ecs_target to
#   module.product.aws_lb_target_group.api, which is a resource of a
#   different type.
#
# Cross-type moves only work when the provider implements MoveState for that
# pair (Terraform >=1.8), which the AWS provider does not for this alias.
# `removed { lifecycle { destroy = false } }` + `import` is the correct
# native substitute: it drops the old address from state without touching
# the real target group, then re-associates the same live resource (verified
# ARN below, matching both prior state and the ARN actually attached to the
# listener rule's forward action) at the new address/type. Like `moved`, it
# is purely declarative and previewed by `plan` — nothing happens to the real
# target group until `apply`.

# aws_ssm_parameter.manifest is NOT moved into the module. The manifest
# assembles ECR/ECS/capture-worker values that are irreducibly
# product-specific (the same reason the module owns no ECS task definition
# or service) — it stays in products/meerkat/manifest.tf, unmoved, only
# repointing its two module-owned fields (webapp bucket id, CloudFront
# distribution id) to module.product outputs.
