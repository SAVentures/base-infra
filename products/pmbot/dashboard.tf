# EP-035: the private history view the public status page cannot give (polymarket-bot docs/runbooks/ops.md). Only
# metrics that exist with Container Insights off (the shared cluster does not enable it): per-service CPU and memory
# utilization and tasks reporting (AWS/ECS), the shared cluster's reservation (every product: is there room for
# EP-034's research slot), job outcomes over days, the paper maker's pulse, the status writer, and one alarm widget.
# The page shows the live state; nothing here repeats it. No host CPU or burst-credit widget: the instance belongs to
# the platform (its ASG has a generated name and no output this stack reads). About $3 a month once the account has
# more than three dashboards.
#
# Every per-service dimension is this cluster and a pmbot-* service; there is no SEARCH() expression (it would read
# the whole account).
