# A quoted term therefore matches both that and the JSON renderer; `tile=<name>` is the console form of a field and
# several terms in one pattern are ANDed. A bare term matches as a substring, so a term must not occur inside the name of an
# event outside the list (checked 2026-10-02 against every log call in strategy-layer/sports/trading: the only
# containments, cancel_pass_failed and engine_halted, sit inside events that are themselves listed; `tick` is the

# Status plane (ops) and collect plane. The status writer (polymarket-bot sports/ops/status_page.py) logs
# `status_published` once per successful 60 s tick and `status_tile_stale tile=<name> state=<s> age_s=<n>` once per
# non-ok health tile per tick, so staleness reaches CloudWatch without giving the writer any write permission.
# The FILTERS are always on: the metrics then have history when the owner flips status_alarms_enabled, and the
# breaching StatusPublished alarm does not page once on the first evaluation. A parked writer logs nothing, so the
# metrics cost nothing then. Only the alarms are gated.
