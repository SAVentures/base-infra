# infra-setup

AWS infrastructure split into a shared platform stack and one Terraform stack per product. The split lets multiple products share one AWS account — one RDS, one ECS cluster, one ALB — without duplicating cost per product.

## Layout

```
infra-setup/
├── platform/               # shared: VPC, RDS, ECS cluster, ALB, Kafka, IAM
└── products/
    └── protoapp/           # protoapp-only: S3, CloudFront, ACM, ECS service, SSM, DNS
```

### State

- **platform** state: `s3://protoapp-infra-terraform-state/state/terraform.tfstate` (unchanged from the pre-split setup)
- **products/protoapp** state: `s3://protoapp-terraform-state/state/terraform.tfstate` (fresh bucket)

Future products get their own state bucket and live in `products/<name>/`.

## How products share the platform

`platform/` exports outputs (ALB ARN, ECS cluster, VPC, subnets, task role, kafka DNS) that product stacks read via `terraform_remote_state`. Each product stack then provisions only its own resources on top.

Routing (once multiple products exist): each product's CloudFront forwards `/api/*` to the shared ALB with a custom `X-Product-Id` header. A per-product listener rule on the ALB matches that header and forwards to the product's target group. One ALB, N products, no path or host collisions.

## Getting started

See [RUNBOOK.md](./RUNBOOK.md) for the protoapp state migration — how to move existing resources from the pre-split state into platform + products/protoapp without recreating anything.

## Adding a new project

Every project is a subdomain of `protoapp.xyz`: a static SPA on S3 + CloudFront
with `/api/*` forwarded to the shared ALB.

1. `cp -r products/_template products/<slug>` and replace every `PROJECT_SLUG`
2. Pick an unused `alb_rule_priority` — sjocamp 100, protoapp 200, new projects
   from 300 in steps of 10. AWS rejects duplicate priorities.
3. `aws s3 mb s3://<slug>-terraform-state`
4. Add the project's ECS task definition and service in `products/<slug>/`,
   wiring `load_balancer.target_group_arn` to `module.product.target_group_arn`
5. `terraform init && terraform apply`
6. Create the project's database and user on the shared RDS instance
7. Populate `/<slug>/*` SSM via a gitignored `secrets.auto.tfvars`

### What the module does and does not cover

`modules/product/` owns **edge and routing**: S3, CloudFront, Cloudflare DNS, the
ALB target group and its `X-Product-Id` listener rule.

It deliberately excludes **compute** (ECS task definition and service) and the
**SSM manifest**. Both are irreducibly product-specific — env blocks and manifest
fields differ per product — so sharing them would mean threading a large map of
pass-through variables through the module, which is worse than the duplication it
removes.

### Session cookies must be host-only

`protoapp.xyz` is not on the Public Suffix List, so a cookie scoped to
`.protoapp.xyz` is readable *and writable* by every sibling subdomain. Set session
cookies with no `Domain=` attribute and `SameSite=Lax` minimum. Cross-project SSO
is a non-goal; the design spec records the sanctioned path if that ever changes.

### Limits

The ALB allows 100 rules per listener, one per project — roughly 95 projects.

## Shared vs per-product

| Resource | Location |
|---|---|
| VPC, subnets, NACLs | platform |
| RDS Postgres instance | platform (one logical DB per product) |
| ECS cluster | platform (one service per product) |
| ALB | platform (one listener rule + target group per product) |
| Kafka broker | platform (one topic prefix per product) |
| CloudFront + S3 webapp | product (via `modules/product`) |
| ACM wildcard cert (`*.protoapp.xyz`) | platform |
| Cloudflare zone settings | platform |
| Cloudflare DNS record | product (via `modules/product`) |
| CloudFront cache/origin-request policies, SPA function | platform (shared) |
| SSM params | `/platform/*` for shared infra, per-product paths for each product |
