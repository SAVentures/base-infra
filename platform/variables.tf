# GitHub Actions OIDC subject patterns allowed to assume the deploy role.
#
# The `owner@ID/repo@ID` entries are NOT redundant with the plain ones. GitHub
# switched to immutable subject claims that embed owner and repository IDs
# (https://github.blog/changelog/2026-04-23-immutable-subject-claims-for-github-actions-oidc-tokens/):
# every repository created, renamed or transferred on or after 2026-07-15 emits
#
#   repo:SAVentures@167594521/tickuptoks@1312020530:ref:refs/heads/main
#
# which `repo:SAVentures/*` cannot match — the character after the org name is
# `@`, not `/`. Repos predating the cutoff keep the old format, so both forms
# have to be listed until every repository has rolled over.
#
# DMSAVentures is the org's former name and no longer resolves on GitHub; its
# entry is left alone rather than cleaned up here, because removing a trust
# subject is a security change that deserves its own review.
